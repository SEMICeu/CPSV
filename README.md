## Core Public Service Vocabulary (CPSV)

This is the issue tracker for the maintenance of the Core Public Service Vocabulary (CPSV).

The Core Public Service Vocabulary is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a service offered by public administration.

The current version of the Core Public Service Vocabulary is [1.0.2](https://github.com/SEMICeu/CPSV/tree/master/releases/1.0.2).

This specification was originally produced to support [CPSV-AP](https://github.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP). Since the merging of the Catalogue of Services and the SEMIC activities the [Core Vocabularies](https://github.com/SEMICeu/Consolidated-Core-Vocabularies) have taken up this role.Therefore CPSV is no longer maintained in a standalone manner it only receives updates if changes occur in CPSV-AP which can not be expressed in the Core Vocabularies.
